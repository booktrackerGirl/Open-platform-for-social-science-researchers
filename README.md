## Vision Statement

> The purpose of this project is to work with collaborators from different universities (starting with the University of Exeter) in developing an open platform for the humanities and social science (HSS) and computational social science (CSS) researchers at the university at various stages of their academic career, where the community can interact with each other through questions and answers on discussions pertaining to open data usage, which would actively shape their future work in ethical and responsible data usage while also promote interdisciplinary and open research across various fields.

# Open-platform-for-social-science-researchers
This repository is created as a part of the OLS cohort 7 project.

The Github issue it is linked with can be found in here: [Open Science platform for humanities and computational social scientists](https://github.com/open-life-science/ols-7/issues/18), which is part of the [OLS cohort-7](https://github.com/open-life-science/ols-7) program.

## Project objectives
Open Data (OD) plays a crucial role in openly sharing scientic knowledge with a worldwide audience (among both academic and non-academic audiences) and encouraging reproducibility. But OD is much less developed in Humanities and Social Science (HSS) research, primarily because of the levels of sensitivity of the data involved, and consent required from participants, which could be difficult for researchers, especially if they are new to data sharing. With the growing interest in computing, researchers working in Computational Social Science (CSS) face similar issues when working with social data in their research, while conforming to legal and ethical restrictions. As per OD guidelines, data must comply with the FAIR principles. But the metrics offered by various OD repositories and publication platforms could be different, which limits the affordances of social activity and the type of OD published. To embrace Open Science projects among HSS and CSS researchers who are working or looking to work with sensitive data, this project proposes a platform (or hub) to promote free, online resources for both professionals and students looking to learn about science and ethics. Here, they can also contribute to discussions related to the topic, post questions, and learn from others' experiences.

### TL;DR: 
A platform to promote free, online resources for both professionals and students looking to learn about science and ethics, where they can also contribute to discussions related to the topic, post questions, and learn from others' experiences.

## Vision Statement

> The purpose of this project is to work with collaborators from different universities (starting with the University of Exeter) in developing an open platform for the humanities and social science (HSS) and computational social science (CSS) researchers at the university at various stages of their academic career, where the community can interact with each other through questions and answers on discussions pertaining to open data usage, which would actively shape their future work in ethical and responsible data usage while also promote interdisciplinary and open research across various fields.
